# Libraries

By the end of the year 2018 there was a unified way of using MobX in React world - library [mobx-react](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react).

Then the [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) came to the light and the [mobx-react-lite](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite) was made. It was great for several enthusiasts, but newcomers did (and still do) suffer.

Consider this a little FAQ on what lib you shall pick

## Cannot use React Hooks yet?

Code with class components and Hooks are out of reach? Just stay with `mobx-react@5`, no worries.

## Fully embraced Hooks?

No class components in your code? Use the `mobx-react-lite` directly, it got you covered.

Note: The library does not include way of propagating state (Provider, inject). Please use the [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Migrating to React Hooks?

Class components still do exists in your code, but there are Hooks as well?

The easiest would be to use `mobx-react@6`, but it's still in beta (as of May 2019) so it's probably better not to use in a important production deployments yet.

The other way is to stick to stable `mobx-react@5` and use `mobx-react-lite` for a migrated components.

The Provider/inject from `mobx-react` is compatible with `mobx-react-lite` in case you prefer it over the [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
