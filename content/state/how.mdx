# How to manage state?

State management in React is very broad topic and new patterns are introduced very often. MobX simplifies some things, but there is several approach to use (#ILikeOptions).

### Mutable state

Important aspect of MobX state is its mutability. On the contrary of popular solutions like Redux or [useReducer] which works best with immutable data structures, the MobX is based on direct mutability to [notify any subscribers](/why-observe) about the change.

### Don't destructure

MobX observable can be objects (and derivates) only. When destructuring, any primite variables will contain last values only and won't be observable anymore. Use [boxed observables](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/boxed.html) to track primitive values exclusively.

## Creating a state

The state in MobX is represented by any [observable object][observable]. Any of the mentioned approaches in linked document are completely in React world.

For advanced and more robust state the better choice might be [mobx-state-tree].

Lastly we have shiny new Hooks to help on this journey like [useLocalStore].

```tsx
function CreatingState() {
  const simpleState = React.useRef(observable.array([1, 2, 3])).current
  const [biggerState] = React.useState(() => createExpensiveStore())
  const localState = useLocalState(() => ({
    count: 0,
    inc() {
      localState.count += 1
    },
  }))
  return (
    <Rendering simple={simpleState} bigger={biggerState} local={localStore} />
  )
}
```

> Fair warning. Don't ever use `React.useMemo` to keep reference to the state object. It might be randomly thrown away by React and would lose data.

## Accessing a state

Second important aspect of state management is how to pass created observable around the component tree. There is no MobX related magic, but it's certainly worth mentioning here.

In simple scenarios you can create an observable locally within a component and then pass it manually through props. It's pretty much the same approach you would use with eg. [useReducer] except you will be passing single object around only.

For a more robust state management it's recommended to use [React Context][context].

## Example

```tsx
import React from 'react'

const storeContext = React.createContext(null)

export const StoreProvider = React.memo(({ children }) => {
  // createStore is your preferred way of creating store
  const [store] = React.useState(createStore)
  return <storeContext.Provider value={store}>{children}</storeContext.Provider>
})

export const useStore = () => {
  return React.useContext(storeContext)
}
```

You can drop `StoreProvider` anywhere in the tree (_top is preferred_) and access store with convenient `useStore` hook. The Provider won't ever re-render (especially with React.memo).

> The `mobx-react` contains its own Provider component and `inject` HOC which exists mostly for legacy reasons. You can achieve the same with React Context in much simpler way. However, feel free to use those tools if you like them or if you cannot use React Hooks yet.
