# State outsourcing

What to do when your rendering depends on both observable value and non-observable one? Regular component props for example.

```
useAsObservableSource<T>(state: T): T
```

The `useAsObservableSource` hook can be used to turn any set of values into an observable object that has a stable reference (the same object is returned every time from the hook).

> The hook is available only with `mobx-react-lite` library or `mobx-react@6`.

The goal of this hook is to trap React primitives such as props or state into a local, observable object so that the [store initializer](/state-local) or [effects](/recipes-effects) can safely refer to it, and get notified if any of the values change.

The value passed to `useAsObservableSource` should always be an object, and is made only shallowly observable.

The object returned by `useAsObservableSource`, although observable, should be considered read-only for all practical purposes.

> Tip: for optimal performance it is recommend to not use `useAsObservableSource` together on the same component as useObserver (or observer), as it might trigger double renderings. Instead, use [Observer component](/observe-component).

import { Playground } from 'docz'
import { Counter, MultiplierInput } from '../examples/Counter'

<Playground>
  <MultiplierInput>
    {multiplier => <Counter multiplier={multiplier} initialCount={1} />}
  </MultiplierInput>
</Playground>

```tsx
import { observer, useAsObservableSource, useLocalStore } from 'mobx-react-lite'

export const Counter = observer(props => {
  const observableProps = useAsObservableSource(props)
  const store = useLocalStore(() => ({
    count: props.initialCount,
    get multiplied() {
      return observableProps.multiplier * store.count
    },
    inc() {
      store.count += 1
    },
  }))

  return (
    <>
      <button id="inc" onClick={store.inc}>
        {`Count: ${store.count}`}
      </button>
      <span>{store.multiplied}</span>
    </>
  )
})
```

## Why to go around like that?

Right. It has probably occured to you why not to do calculation directly in rendering?

It will definitely work well for such contrived example. However, consider that your calculation could be much more complicated and it's good to keep things together.

You might also want to pass that store further down the tree. Do you really want to repeat the calculation in every spot? It's highly unlikely.

## Don't destructure

There is a whole [page dedicated to destructuring problem](/state-destructuring), but as it's common source of errors, let's repeat in here. Don't ever do `const { multiplier } = useAsObservableSource(props)`. Such value would not be observable anymore.
