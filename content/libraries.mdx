# Libraries

By the end of the year 2018 there was a unified way of using MobX in React world - library [mobx-react].

Then the [React Hooks] came to the light. The [mobx-react-lite] was made to support this brave new world.

It was great for several enthusiasts, but newcomers did (and still do) suffer.

**You cannot use [mobx-react-lite] with class components.**

> In not so distant future the `mobx-react-lite` might be deprecated and become a `mobx-react@7`.
>
> Don't worry, migration will be as easy as replacing one string for another.

## Cannot use React Hooks yet?

🤷‍♂️ **Your code has class components while Hooks are out of reach?**

👌 Just stay with `mobx-react@5`, no worries.

## Fully embraced Hooks?

🤷‍♂️ **No class components in your code?**

👌 Use the `mobx-react-lite` directly, it got you covered.

> The library does not include way of propagating state (Provider, inject), see more about [accessing state](/state-how#accessing-a-state).

## Migrating to React Hooks?

🤷‍♂️ **Class components still do exists in your code, but there are Hooks as well?**

👌The easiest would be to use `mobx-react@6`, but it's still in beta (as of May 2019) so it's probably better not to use in a important production deployments yet.

👌The other way is to stick to stable `mobx-react@5` and use `mobx-react-lite` for a migrated components.

> The Provider/inject from `mobx-react` is compatible with `mobx-react-lite` in case you prefer it over the [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
