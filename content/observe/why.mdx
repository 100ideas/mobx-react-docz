# Why to observe?

MobX is based on concept of **observables** which may feel like magical tiny boxes (_as everything unknown_), but it's fairly simple actually.

If you have ever worked with [PubSub-like patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) (eg. _EventEmitter_), the observable it's fairly similar concept, but wrapped into a fancy package.

- It will take care of adding/removing listeners while you focus on declaring what data you need.
- It's time-proof. You will always get a latest value no matter when you start observing.

This is great React world as you can stick to a declarative way of writing component and simply work with data without additional hurdles and boilerplate.

<Playground>
  <Counter multiplier={5} initialCount={1} />
</Playground>

```tsx
import { observer, useAsObservableSource, useLocalStore } from 'mobx-react-lite'

interface Props {
  initialCount: number
  multiplier: number
}

export const Counter = observer<Props>(props => {
  const observableProps = useAsObservableSource(props)
  const store = useLocalStore(() => ({
    count: props.initialCount,
    get multiplied() {
      return observableProps.multiplier * store.count
    },
    inc() {
      store.count += 1
    },
  }))

  return (
    <div>
      <span>{store.count}</span> * <span>{props.multiplier}</span> ={' '}
      <span>{store.multiplied}</span>{' '}
      <button id="inc" onClick={store.inc}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
})
```
