# Side effects and observables

You might have been using [`React.useEffect`][useeffect] for several reasons, eg. setting `document.title` dynamically or for managing timers.

What if your side effect actually depends on observable value? Don't worry, MobX got you covered.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { autorun } from 'mobx'

function DocumentTitle() {
  const store = useStore()

  React.useEffect(
    () =>
      autorun(() => {
        document.title = `${store.title} - ${store.sectionName}`
      }),
    [],
  )

  return null
}
```

Important realization here is that you will never need to specify dependencies for `useEffect` because there are simply none. Or to be more precise it does depend on `store` variable, but that's the same case as for `React.useRef` which value you shouldn't specify in dependencies also.

> We might eventually provide utility hooks like `useAutorun` or `useReaction`, but these are very easy to make on your own if you don't want to wait.

Since the `autorun` (and others from MobX family) returns a disposal function, it's ensured that `useEffect` will take care of disposal on unmount of the component.

## Non-observable dependencies

What if effect depends on value from eg. props? One way is certainly to specify it in dependency array of `useEffect` as you have been taught. However that means a reaction would be recreated and that's not very effective.

Much better way is to `useAsObservableSource` ([learn more](/state-outsourcing)).

```tsx
function Fetcher({ baseUrl, resource }) {
  const observables = useAsObservableSource({ url: `${baseUrl}/${resource}` })
  const store = useStore()

  React.useEffect(
    () =>
      reaction(
        () => `${observables.url}/${store.itemId}`,
        fetchUrl => {
          fetch(fetchUrl).then(result => {
            store.setResult(result)
          })
        },
      ),
    [],
  )

  return null
}
```

Instead of constantly thinking what dependencies you should provide, you simply use those variables and let MobX figure out the rest. Isn't it great?
